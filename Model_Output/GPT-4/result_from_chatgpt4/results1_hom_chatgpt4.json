The internal, self-contained bin can hold up to 22 pounds of ice when filled to capacity. At just 15 inches wide and 33 inches tall, Hoshizaki's C-101BAH-DS requires very little room in which to operate. As a smaller ice machine, the C-101BAH-DS is perfect for residential uses, and also fits in well in the office or break room. The Hoshizaki C-101BAH-DS is also conveniently approved for outdoor use, expanding even further the places in which you can have ice created. The cubelet ice is soft and chewable, and retains the flavors of the drinks it cools. The C-100BAF-DS from Hoshizaki was designed with fewer moving parts as well, to extend its life expectancy, and minimize the risk of the ice maker running into problems or breakdowns from extensive wear and tear. The C-101BAH-DS can also be equipped with a door system, so owners can apply custom cabinetry to this ice maker, allowing it to fit in with, or stand out from existing appliances. NOTE* The cabinet door is NOT included, and must be provided by the customer.\"@en-US ",
